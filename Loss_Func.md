The line:

```python
loss = F.smooth_l1_loss(current_q_values, target_q_values)
```

computes the **Huber loss**, which is also called **Smooth L1 Loss**. This loss function is commonly used in **reinforcement learning**, especially in algorithms like **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**, because it's **less sensitive to outliers** than Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.

### Huber Loss Formula

The Huber loss is defined as:

$$
L(a) = 
\begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{2}(a)^2 & \text{for } |a| \leq \delta \\
\delta(|a| - \frac{1}{2}\delta) & \text{for } |a| > \delta
\end{cases}
$$

Where:

* $a = \text{current\_q\_values} - \text{target\_q\_values}$
* $\delta$ is typically set to 1 in PyTorch’s `smooth_l1_loss`

### Characteristics

* Acts like **Mean Squared Error** when the absolute error is small (|a| ≤ 1)
* Acts like **Mean Absolute Error** when the absolute error is large (|a| > 1)
* Smoothly transitions between L2 and L1 losses, offering a good balance between stability and robustness to outliers

### In Context

In the DQN setting:

* `current_q_values` are the predicted Q-values from the neural network
* `target_q_values` are computed using the Bellman equation, involving rewards and the max Q-value from the next state

Using Huber loss helps prevent the training from being too heavily influenced by large errors, which can happen with unstable Q-value targets.
